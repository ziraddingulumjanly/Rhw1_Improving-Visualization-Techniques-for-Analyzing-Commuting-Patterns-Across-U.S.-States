# Rhw1_Improving-Visualization-Techniques-for-Analyzing-Commuting-Patterns-Across-U.S.-States
The Python code implementation for Improving Visualization Techniques for Analyzing Commuting Patterns Across U.S. States

The objective of the following display is to show that “Proportionally, people in DC commute by walking more than people in these other five states.” ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b2ebab-bc41-4507-84a1-f12adb9f9435)
However, this visual display breaks several fundamental guidelines, including the principles “show the data and facilitate comparison” and “focus on the objective.” Your task is to:


a)	 an alternative display of the data that would be an improvement for visualizing its objective. 
b)	 describe how your visualization is an improvement from the original.
